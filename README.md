Hi there, I'm Rivindu Ashinsa  
Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | Data Scientist | CS Undergraduate

Driven and detail-oriented computer science undergraduate with a strong foundation in data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence. Passionate about using data to solve real-world problems, I have hands-on experience with end-to-end ML pipelines, computer vision applications, deep learning models, and multi-agent AI systems. 

I’ve contributed to impactful projects such as brain tumor detection using CNNs, AI-powered health platforms, and supply chain automation using LangGraph agents. My portfolio showcases skills in both classical ML and advanced deep learning, with multiple certifications from Google, Kaggle, IBM, and more.  

Having ranked competitively in hackathons and Kaggle competitions, I’m constantly expanding my capabilities in neural networks, model optimization, and cloud-integrated AI workflows. I thrive in collaborative environments and aim to bring innovation, structure, and impact to any team or organization I’m a part of.
