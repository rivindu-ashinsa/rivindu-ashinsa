# Hi there 👋 I'm Rivindu Ashinsa  
🎓 Computer Science Undergraduate | 🤖 Aspiring Machine Learning Engineer | 📊 Data Scientist  

Motivated and analytical computer science undergraduate with a strong foundation in machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence. I specialize in building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems — from predictive modeling to AI-driven automation.  

With hands-on experience across supervised learning, deep learning (CNNs, ANNs), and computer vision, I’ve worked on diverse projects such as brain tumor detection using MRI scans, AI health platforms, and supply chain automation with LangGraph agents.  

I'm passionate about continuous learning, open-source contribution, and transforming ideas into scalable solutions. My work is supported by recognized certifications from Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Kaggle.
